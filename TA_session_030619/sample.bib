  abstract  = {Multiplicative interaction models are common in the quantitative political
	science literature. This is so for good reason. Institutional arguments
	frequently imply that the relationship between political inputs and
	outcomes varies depending on the institutional context. Models of
	strategic interaction typically produce conditional hypotheses as
	well. Although conditional hypotheses are ubiquitous in political
	science and multiplicative interaction models have been found to
	capture their intuition quite well, a survey of the top three political
	science journals from 1998 to 2002 suggests that the execution of
	these models is often flawed and inferential errors are common. We
	believe that considerable progress in our understanding of the political
	world can occur if scholars follow the simple checklist of dos and
	don'ts for using multiplicative interaction models presented in this
	article. Only 10\% of the articles in our survey followed the checklist.},

  abstract  = {Though the inclusion of multiplicative terms in multiple regression equations is often prescribed as a method for assessing interaction in multivariate relationships, the technique has been criticized for yielding results that are hard to interpret, unreliable (as a result of multicollinearity between the multiplicative term and its constituent variables), and even meaningless. An interpretation of a multiple regression equation with a multiplicative term in conditional terms reveals all these criticisms to be unfounded. In fact, it is better analytic strategy to include a multiplicative term than to exclude one.},
